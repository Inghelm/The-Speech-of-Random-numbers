# The-Speech-of-Random-numbers
This is the "soundbook" to The book of random numbers.

I have used the P5JS - p5.speech lib.

No changes made yet, but I want to write less code to do the same. 
I am not quite sure about the function windowResized(), if i need all the code I have there. 
Some of that code is nessesary but not all.
